Inside this repository there are:
- [Data](https://github.com/ReLandProject/ReLandTishreen/tree/main/data) used in the paper _**From The Tigris To The Banks Of The Euphrates: Post-Flooding Assessment At The Tishreen Dam Reservoir, North Syria. Paola Sconzo, Francesca Simi, and Andrea Titolo, to be published in Mesopotamia journal**_ 
  - **NOTE**: the present digital archive does not include original data used in the analysis (sites shapefile) as they are still under the process of publication. We are sorry for the inconvenience, but we will make sure to include a link to the dataset as soon as it will be available.
  - **Additional NOTE**: NDWI Raster data generated in Google Earth Engine/ R are not present in this repository because of their size, but they can be downloaded from [figshare](https://figshare.com/s/a3bdd14642cb41888b4d). Alternatively they can be generated using the GEE scripts or the R scripts in this repository.
  - When downloading the images from figshare, **make sure to place them in their respective folder**, i.e.: _**data/processed/raster/time_series_1999_2023**_ (inside the project folder). Otherwise the script for the zonal histogram will not work.
  - Reclassified NDWI composites generated through the 02_image_reclassification.R script (see below).
  - Mean water level data per chosen months generated from the [Database for Hydrological Time Series of Inland Waters (DAHITI)](https://dahiti.dgfi.tum.de/en/) as CSV.
  - Mean water surface data per chosen months as CSV, generated by polygonizing NDWI data.
- [Code](https://github.com/ReLandProject/ReLandTishreen/tree/main/code) used to carry out the analyses. In detail:
  - **Google Earth Engine (GEE) Javascript code**, available in the relative [subfolder](https://github.com/ReLandProject/ReLandTishreen/tree/main/code/JS), used to generate monthly composites used in the analysis:  
    - A script for generating Landsat images.
    - A second script for generating Sentinel-2 images.
    - These two scripts are also available directly in Google Earth Engine
      - [Link for Landsat script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/1aac43bc982b2822975d5d2f7b933db5?noload=true)
      - [Link for Sentinel script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/56957a9fee40065064c4b69278b4e198?noload=true)
  - **R code** divided in five main scripts and one functions script, used to run the analysis, available in the [Script Subfolder](https://github.com/ReLandProject/ReLandTishreen/tree/master/code/R).
    - The scripts are named in the order they are supposed to be run:
    - `01_rgee_image_collections.R` → an adaptation of the Google Earth Engine scripts in R, thanks to the [{rgee}](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee) package.
    - `02_image_reclassification.R` → a small script to reclassify the NDWI images generated from the previous script.
    - `03_emerged_area_pct.R` → script that leverages the [{qgisprocess}](https://github.com/r-spatial/qgisprocess) package and R to extract water and non-water pixels inside polygons representing sites extent (using the zonal histogram output from QGIS). It also gather all the outputs from the algorithm and merge them to create a single shapefile with readable percentages of emerged/submerged surface.
    - `04_quantitative_pct_info.R` → script that add some quantitative information to the output of the previous scripts, useful for wider interpretations.
    - `05_dataviz.R` → script to generate the figures present in the paper. 
    - A function folder with a `get_emerged_area.R` script. Here reside some functions that will be called from the other scripts (02, 03, 04).
  - **QGIS processing tools**, in the [QGIS Subfolder](https://github.com/ReLandProject/ReLandTishreen/tree/main/code/QGIS):
    - Standalone qgis model as .model3 file
      - This model covers the steps carried out in the 02 and half of the 03 scripts described above
- **Accuracy assessment data** used for the error matrix mentioned in the paper (available on [figshare](https://figshare.com/s/c8c834c5296d461febc3) because of data size).
- The present repository is also archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13164502).

# Reproduce the analysis 

More detailed instructions on how to reproduce the analyses are available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/ReLandProject/ReLandTishreen/wiki).

# A note about the RGEE code

The R package [rgee](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee) was used to interact with Google Earth Engine. Unfortunately the package is currently not actively maintained by the main author, who reported that maintenance has been challenging due to the constant changes in the Google Earth Engine API.

Source: [r-spatial/rgee#359](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee/issues/359#issuecomment-2047191480)

For now the scripts work locally, but we are starting to experience authentication issues as reported by many other users. One option could be to switch to [geemap](https://github.com/gee-community/geemap), which is a python library. This will likely introduce another element of friction as we will have to maintain the code in three languages (JavaScript, R, Python), so it is not something we are planning in the near future, and if done, it will take some time. If you are encountering issues with _rgee_, we recommend using the JS scripts to download the images, and then proceed to reproduce the analyses from the `02` script.
